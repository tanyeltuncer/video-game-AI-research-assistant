    "UdaPlay, is an AI Research Agent for the video game industry. The agent is built on StateMachine[AgentState] with following steps:\n",
    "1. message_prep – builds messages (system + user + history)\n",
    "2. llm_processor – calls LLM.invoke(). OpenAI may respond with: normal text or tool_calls (e.g. retrieve_game, search_research_memory, etc.)\n",
    "3. tool_executor – runs the tool functions. It looks at each ToolCall\n",
    "- Finds the matching Tool object by name\n",
    "- Calls it with parsed arguments\n",

The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the anime \"Pokémon (anime)\")\\'s first season. Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with Pokémon Stadium and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate was taken over by Pokémon Yellow.
